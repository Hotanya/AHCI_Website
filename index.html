        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As the user interface has evolved from text-based command line to modern graphical interface, the main input devices have shifted from keyboards to mice. Today, the average active time on mouse is almost 3 times than the active time on keyboards (Odell, 2015). According to Odell (2015), the intensive mouse usage has been identified as one of the key risk factors for Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) such as carpal tunnel syndrome. Ergonomic mouse is therefore designed to alleviate the discomfort when using the standard mouse for a long period of time.</p>

        <p>The first ergonomic mouse that I could find is the Evoluent ergonomic mouse which was invented and patented by Jack Lo (founder of Evoluent) due to the discomfort he had when using a standard mouse (Evoluent, 2017) in 1994 (see figure 1). The concept of an ergonomic mouse has been around for about 23 years and it was only introduced about 10 years later than the first widely used mouse which ships with Apple Macintosh as standard equipment (Greenemeier, 2009) in 1984. However, the ergonomic mouse has not become the mainstream point and click device as the standard mouse. In the following sections, we will uncover some of the reasons of why people prefer to use the standard mouse.</p>

        <h3>What is an ergonomic mouse: </h3>
        <p>Based on the definition from webopedia (2017), an ergonomic mouse is a type of mouse that has been designed to reduce muscle strain and decrease the chance of injuries (such as carpal tunnel syndrome, arthritis, and tendonitis) by fitting more naturally in hand when being used.</p>
        
        <h3>Benefits of using ergonomic mouse: </h3>
        <p>Because the natural resting position of the wrist and forearm is the ‘thumbs-up’ position contrast to the position the standard flat mouse puts you arm in and rotating the forearm to get the hand in a palm down position (pronation) based on Ergo Inc (2017). Most ergonomic mice are therefore designed with a vertical grip to achieve a natural hand position. One of the main benefits of using a ergonomic mouse is it can prevent pronation (which is highly associated with carpal tunnel syndrome).</p>

    <div id="methodology" class="tabcontent">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        
        <h3>What is qualitative research: </h3>
        <p>Qualitative research is characterised by its aims (which relate to understanding some aspect of social life) and its methods which generate words rather than numbers as data for analysis (Brikci, 2006). Qualitative research is especially effective in obtaining specific information about individual’s opinions, experiences and values. It provides information about the “human” side of an issue such as contradictory behaviors, opinions, emotions and relationships between individuals (Northeastern University, 2017).</p> 
        
        <h3>What are some qualitative research methods: </h3>
        <p>The three most common qualitative research methods are participant observation, in-depth interview and focus groups. Each method is suited for obtaining a specific type of data (Northeastern University, 2017).</p>    
        <ul>
            <li>Participant observation is appropriate for collecting data on naturally occurring behaviors in their usual contexts.</li>
            <li>Interviews are optimal for collecting data on individuals’ personal histories, perspectives, and experiences, particularly when sensitive topics are being explored.</li>
            <li>Focus groups are effective in eliciting data on the cultural norms of a group and in generating broad overviews of issues of concern to the cultural groups or subgroups represented.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Our Research question: </h3>
        <p>Our research question is “why do people prefer using standard mouse over ergonomic mouse”.</p>   

        <h3>Why we chose qualitative research:</h3>
        <p>Our research question try to uncover some of the reasons on why people prefer using standard mouse instead of the ergonomically designed mouse which are supposed to be more comfortable in hand. It focuses more on the human side of issue which is about individual’s experience of using different mouse and their opinions. Qualitative research is ideal to help us resolve this research question.</p>
        
        <h3>What are our methods: </h3>
        <p>Our group decided to use both participant observation and in-depth interviews as our research methods.</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Participant observation: We gave all participants the same set of tasks to perform to get them used to both standard and ergonomic mouse. When they are using both mouse to perform tasks, we observed how they use both mouse to find some common patterns and take notes. The tasks we gave them include both daily activities (such as copy and paste text from a website to a word document, drawing different shapes on the Microsoft Paint) and a simple online mouse accuracy clicking test (see figure below). The reason we included the mouse accuracy test in the tasks is because we want to understand if there is any difference in point and click accuracy between standard and ergonomic mouse (which could be one reason why people prefer using standard mouse). A full description of the task can be found in the appendix section.</li>
            <li><img src="images/mousetest.png" style="height:50%;width:50%;" /></li>
            <li>Interview: After the participant finished the task, we interviewed them to find out which one they prefer to use and why. The type of interview we did is semi-structured interview which provides a clear set of instructions for interviewers that could provide reliable, comparable qualitative data and also allow interviewers to follow topical trajectories in the conversation that may stray from the guide when he or she feels appropriate (Cohen, 2006).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We designed our questions based on the guideline from Brikci (2006) that it should aim to be reproducible (some else could use the same topic guide to generate similar information), systematic (not just picking interviewees or data that support our pre-existing ideas about the answers), credible (the question should be reasonable for generating valid accounts of phenomena), and transparent (so that they know how the data is collected and analysed). Some of our interview questions include: “Was there anything specifically that you found particularly easy or difficult when using ergonomic mouse? If yes, what and why?”, “Would you use the ergonomic mouse for daily computer activities? Why or why not?”, “What is your opinion on the ergonomic mouse? Any thoughts, comments or suggestions?”</p>
        
        <h3>Sampling: </h3>
        <p>Choosing a study sample is a crucial step in any research project since it is rarely practical, efficient or ethical to study whole population (Marshall, 1996). We acknowledge that we might not use the most effective sample strategy to gather data as we only have limited amount of time and resources. However, we try our best to ensure the reliability and quality of our data by having a larger sample size of 10 and making sure the sample group consists of different sexes, majors and cultural backgrounds. By choosing proper sample group and sample size enable us to generate more meaningful and credible data to draw conclusion on.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <img src="images/SuccessfulClicks.png" style="padding-left:40px;" />  <img src="images/Misclicks.png" style="padding-left:150px;" />
        <p class="resultpage">The two graphs above show the results from the experiment we conducted to test the mouse accuracy between an Optical Mouse (HP T3A002) and Ergonomic Mouse (Evoluent Vertical Mouse 4). Participants had to do/play a test/game at mouseaccuracy.com, where you have to click on the objects that appears on the screen before it totally disappear. This game tests the accuracy of the mouse by recording your score and displaying the number of successful and unsuccessful clicks. They show the average results from the three attempt they did.</p>

        <h3>Successful Clicks</h3>
        <p> The Graph on the left compares the Successful Clicks between the Optical Mouse Clicks and Ergonomic mouse. From this  we can clearly see that participants using the Optical Mouse have a much higher accuracy score than participants using an Ergonomic Mouse. The combined average of successful clicks for all the participants using the Optical mouse was 13.3 whereas the for the Ergonomic mouse, it is a paltry 5.3, with one participant only managing to get 1 successful click.</p>

        <h3>Misclicks</h3>
        <p>The graph on the right compares the Misclicks between the Optical Mouse and the Ergonomic Mouse. In this we can see that the opposite holds true, there is a drastic increase in the number of misclicks whilst using the Ergonomic mouse as compared to the Optical Mouse. The participants using the Optical Mouse had a total average of 2.7 with 1 participant having no misclicks! Whereas the total average for Ergonomic Mouse was 5.7</p>
        
        <p>All participants are familiar and have used a standard mouse, however around half stated that they use the trackpad of a laptop more. Many participants mentioned that the greatest source of the difficulties and uncomfortableness or due to the unfamiliarity with the ergonomic mouse. as they use it on a day to day basis whereas all participants stated that they have never used a similar ergonomic mouse before. They claim that they have never heard of it even though this specific style of mouse has been around since 2002 (Campbell et al., 2002).</p>

        
        <p>All participants prefered using an optical mouse because they are user friendly and easy to understand compared to the ergonomic mouse. Participants stated that they have never used a similar ergonomic mouse before. They claim that they have never heard of it even though this specific style of mouse has been around since 2002 (Campbell et al., 2002). The participants couldn’t understand how to use the ergonomic mouse and users needed more assistance. Some people didn’t know how to copy due to the lack of knowledge of the third button on the mouse.</p>

        <p>All participants are familiar and have used a standard mouse, however around half stated that they use the trackpad of a laptop more. Many participants mentioned that the greatest source of the difficulties and uncomfortableness or due to the unfamiliarity with the ergonomic mouse.</p>

        <img src="images/standardmousefrequency.png" style="height:35%;width:35%" />
        <p>Majority of the participants stated that they found using the standard mouse to complete the tasks either easy or very easy. Only one participant found using the standard mouse neither easy nor difficult. None of the participants found using the standard mouse difficult or very difficult. In contrast to the standard mouse, only one participant found using the ergonomic mouse easy to use. Most of the participants stated that they found using the ergonomic mouse to complete the tasks either difficult or very difficult. One participant found using the ergonomic mouse neither easy nor difficult. All participants stated that they found the standard mouse overall easier to use for completing the tasks.</p>
        
        <img src="images/standardmouseease.png" style="height:35%;width:35%" />
        <img src="images/ergomouseease.png" style="height:35%;width:35%" />

        <img src="images/whichmouseeasy.png" style="height:35%;width:35%" />
        <p>A few participants mentioned that the ergonomic mouse was particularly difficult to use when completing the clicking test because it was harder to control. This could be because the ergonomic mouse uses upper arm muscles to move it instead of lower arm muscles used to move the standard mouse. Movements made with larger muscle groups are less precise unlike the fine smaller movements made using smaller muscle groups (Scarlet, 2005). The loss of finer movements made the clicking test more difficult. </p>
        <p>Some participants mentioned that some difficulties arose from the button positions of the ergonomic mouse. They couldn’t be seen from the way the mouse is gripped. They weren’t distinguishable through tactile means. They also felt that the arrangement of the buttons was not instinctively placed. This was exhibited when many made the mistake of assuming the middle button had the right click functions when it was the third button that had those functions. Some didn’t even realize that there was a third button to use.</p>
        <p>Participants found all the activities more difficult to perform using the ergonomic mouse except one. Several participants mentioned that the ergonomic mouse was easier to use for drawing shapes in the “Microsoft Paint” program. It was also exhibited in the results of their drawings. The shapes drawn using the ergonomic mouser significantly better looking compared to the shapes drawn using the standard mouse. Some of the participants thought that this was because the grip of the ergonomic mouse is like the way a pen is gripped when drawing on paper.</p>
        <p><img src="images/Participant1.jpeg" style="height:35%;width:35%" /> <img src="images/Participant1Ergo.jpeg" style="height:35%;width:35%" /> </p>
        <p>Majority of the participants stated that they found using the standard mouse very comfortable or comfortable when completing the tasks. Two participants stated that they found the standard mouse neither comfortable nor uncomfortable to use. Only one participant found the standard mouse uncomfortable to use. The ergonomic mouse got very mixed feedback when it came to comfortability of use. Four participants stated that they found using the ergonomic mouse comfortable or very comfortable when completing the tasks. Another four participants stated that they found using the ergonomic mouse uncomfortable or very uncomfortable. The remaining two participants found the ergonomic mouse neither comfortable nor uncomfortable. 80% of the participants found the standard more comfortable to use. The remaining 20% found the ergonomic mouse more comfortable to use.</p>

        <img src="images/ergomousecomfort.png" style="height:35%;width:35%" />
        <img src="images/whichmousecomfort.png" style="height:35%;width:35%" />
        <p>These results were unexpected considering that the ergonomic mouse was designed with comfort in mind. The ergonomic mouse’s shape supports the user’s hand in an upright neutral position. This prevents forearm twisting that usually results from the user’s hand position when using a standard mouse, thus alleviating wrist pain (Campbell et al., 2002). While the ergonomic mouse is designed to reduce wrist movement they also increase muscle activity in the shoulders (Scarlet, 2005). Instead of exerting effort with the lower arm, effort s exerted with the upper arm. This could be the one source of the discomfort experienced by the participants. It was also mentioned by some participants that the mouse felt heavier to move because it was so bulky. One participant likened moving the mouse to moving a cup. This could be another source of discomfort for the participants.</p>
        <p>All participants stated they prefer to use the standard mouse over the ergonomic mouse. However, if they were given an ergonomic mouse they around half of the participants said they would try to use it. 40% of the participants said they would use the ergonomic mouse for daily or leisure activities. They stated that their reason for agreeing to use it was because there is no need to be very efficient for daily or leisure activities so it wouldn’t matter much to use the ergonomic mouse. They also stated that given enough time they believe they would get familiarized with it and thus become more efficient with it. 60% of the participants said they would use the ergonomic mouse for work related activities. They stated that their reason for agreeing to use it was because of the comfort it offers for long hours of work. Despite the it’s inefficiency they would use the ergonomic mouse because they prioritize their health more. Participants who stated they would not give the ergonomic mouse a chance because it was unreliable.</p>
